# JobAnalyticportal

Real-Time Job Analytics Dashboard project aims to develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights into the job market. By leveraging data cleaning and analysis capabilities of Python and the visualization power of Tableau, we have created a comprehensive platform to explore and understand job trends.

The core of the project involves extracting raw job data from Kaggle, refining it through meticulous data cleaning processes using Python, and subsequently integrating it into Tableau to construct insightful visualizations. The developed dashboard is then exported as an HTML file and hosted on a Netlify platform to ensure accessibility and real-time updates. Any modifications made within Tableau are seamlessly reflected on the HTML dashboard, guaranteeing data consistency and freshness.

This project represents a collaborative effort to harness the potential of data analytics to provide valuable insights into the job market.
